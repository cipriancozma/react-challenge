# Info about how I decided to work on the app
Well, if I would had more time to work on the app, definitely I would improved the UI part in terms of colors, design, let's say.
I preferred to work with Context but I would choose Redux instead, but since it is a small app, it is okay at the moment.

I think that for the layout of the BookItem I could use a UI component instead and not repeat myself with css.
For instance I could create a UICard component and have it for all the BookItems components.

If I would had more time also I would have choosen scss instead css and use variables, mixins and other advantages of the preprocessor and not repeat myself with some css declarations.

There is work to do with refactoring, but in my opinion it's not so much to refactor. It is easy to understand the code I wrote and easy to maintain.

Maybe I would choose to use useReducer instead so many useState in the Homepage component but I preferred to not complicate myself and keep the things simple at the moment, but for sure I would do the modifications if I would have some time in the future.

I also would include more reusable components, for buttons, let's say. To create a Button Component and reuse it where I need.

For the component tree part I am satisfied right now how this looks but I would do some improvements also in this direction.
There's room for improvement.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
